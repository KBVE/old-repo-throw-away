# Meme.sh - Serverless Meme Website
* This has been an older project that we wanted to bring back! The current public repo is from 2017, while the private repo is from 2019? So for 2022, we will go ahead and merge up some concepts/ideas from the past two instances into the 3rd open instance.

## 2022 (new repo! - 3rd instance)
* Markdown based blog.
* Serverless with all blog posts being made/held open source through Github.
* Will update with more information, as I continue to migrate and test case some of the possible solutions for the 3rd instance.

## 2017/2019 (old repos - 1st/2nd instance)
* We were running a penta lxc container system with nodejs/koa/nginx as the backend.
** LXC1 - Nginx Reverse Proxy / Firewall
** LXC2 - NodeJS Blog - Koa/Socket
** LXC3 - Static File Host - Handled all the images, css, js files.
** LXC4 - Database - MariaDB
** LXC5 - Debian - Backup Solution/Manager
